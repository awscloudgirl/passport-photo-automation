## S3 Triggers: Automating Image Processing for the Cloudtopia Passport Office Automation Project

![Module 1](/assets/s3-lambda-function.png)

To automate the image processing workflow, I will use a feature of S3 called Triggers. S3 Triggers allow you to notify other AWS services when a file gets created, modified, or deleted. For this project, I am interested in using the PUT notification type, which corresponds to file uploads.

When S3 triggers the Lambda function, it will provide the S3 bucket and file details of the uploaded file in the event arguments. This information will be used to interact with Amazon Rekognition, enabling the automated evaluation of passport photos. As you proceed through the following steps, you'll see how S3 Triggers seamlessly integrate with other AWS services to streamline the photo validation process.

### Step 1: Create an s3 Bucket with a Lambda Trigger

* click `Create bucket`
* Type in a global name
* Leave all the default settings
* Click `Create Bucket`

* Go to Lambda 
* Click `Create Function`
* Type a name for the function
* Change the language to Python 3.12 under `Runtime`
* Leave all the default settings
* Click `Create function`

Once the function is created and you see the PhotoValidationProcessor function overview:

* Click `Add Trigger`
* Add s3 in the `Select a source` dropdown
* Select the `CloudTopia-Images` bucket that was created
* Leave all the other options as default
* Check the box under `Recursive invocations`
* Click `Add`

You will then see the creation of the trigger reflected in the function overview:

![S3 Trigger Added](/assets/function-s3-added.png)

This Lambda trigger is configured to respond to new file uploads in the S3 bucket `cloudtopia-images-jun-2024`. It activates on `s3:ObjectCreated:Put` events, meaning the associated Lambda function will execute whenever a new object is added to the bucket. This enables automatic processing of files immediately upon upload and then the system can efficiently handle incoming passport photos without manual intervention.

S3 now has the permission to invoke the Lambda function but to be able to read the data, additional permissions are needed. These permissions need to be added separately via IAM. 

![Permissions](/assets/permissions.png)

* Click `Permissions`
* Click the link under `Role name`

The page opens in IAM on `PhotoValidationProcessor-role` page which has a default `Cloudwatch` policy already attached to it. 

![Create Inline Policy](/assets/inline-policy.png)

* Click `Create inline policy`

![Specify Permissions](/assets/specify-permissions.png)

* Click the dropdown and select `S3`

![S3 Specify Permissions](/assets/s3-specify.png)

* Scroll down and click on `Read`
* Select `GetObject`
* Scroll down and click on `Resources`
* Click on `Add ARNs`
* Add the bucket name in `Resource bucket name`
* Check the `Any object name box`
* Click `Add ARNs`

Once created, it is automatically attached to the Lambda function.

Next, test that the function works:

* Go back to the S3 bucket
* Click `Upload` and upload an image
* Go back to the Lambda function and check if the function executed

![Function Cloudwatch](/assets/function-cw.png)

* Click on `CloudwatchWatch logs`
* Scroll down the page to `Log streams` and see the function
