# Integrating with DynamoDB: Storing Photo Evaluation Results

To streamline the photo evaluation workflow, results from Amazon Rekognition will be stored in DynamoDB using the PutItem API. This involves defining a data model for our DynamoDB table, called ValidationRequests, with fields such as FileName, ValidationResult, FailureReasons, Timestamp, FileLocation, and FaceDetails.

FileName will serve as the partition key, uniquely identifying each record. ValidationResult will indicate the outcome of the evaluation. FailureReasons will list any issues for photos that fail validation. Timestamp will record the evaluation time in ISO8601 format. FileLocation will store the S3 file location, and FaceDetails will contain the Rekognition analysis in JSON format.

Utilizing DynamoDB for storing these results ensures efficient data handling and retrieval, enhancing the automation and scalability of the Cloudtopia Passport Office Automation Project.

## Step 1: Decide Data Model & DynamoDB Table Schema

## Step 2: Create DynamoDB ValidationRequests Table

## Step 3: Call PUTItem API

## Step 4: Attach IAM Policy DynamoDB;PUTItem to PhotoValidationProcessor
